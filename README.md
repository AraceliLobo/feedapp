# Welcome to feedApp!

## The project

A **responsive web app (mobile-first)** conceived to help you get **live feedback** from your students on your online trainings. Students will be able to let you know how they are feeling in real time about the contents and pace of the training session, or their current state of mind.

## The team

We are [Ana](https://github.com/anamartinezfernandez), [√Ångela](https://github.com/chicano85), [Araceli](https://github.com/AraceliLobo) and [Celia](https://github.com/Celiamf), four **motivated Front-End Women Developers** who code to learn and make nice things for others.
